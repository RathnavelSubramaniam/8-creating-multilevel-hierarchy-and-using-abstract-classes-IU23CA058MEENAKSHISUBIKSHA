P8 : Creating Multilevel Hierarchy and Using Abstract Classes
Task 1: Multilevel Inheritance
● Design a base class "Animal" with basic attributes and methods.
● Create subclasses "Mammal" and "Bird" inheriting from "Animal" and adding
specific attributes.
● Implement a subclass "Parrot" extending from "Bird" with additional
characteristics.
Task 2: Abstract Classes and Final with Inheritance
● Introduce an abstract method in the "Animal" class for sound.
● Prevent further inheritance by using "final" with certain methods or classes.
Task 3: Object Class and Method Overriding
● Discuss and demonstrate the use of methods from the "Object" class such as
toString() and equals().
● Override the toString() method in the subclasses for specific representations.
